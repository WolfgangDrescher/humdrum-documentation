Instrumentation Codes
=====================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

Humdrum provides standard voice and instrument names in order to
facilitate various tasks. Voice and instrument names are used both in
tandem interpretations, and in `AIN` reference records identifying the
instrumentation for a work (see [**Appendix I**](guide.append1.html#AIN)).

Instrument tandem interpretations are used to identify the
instrumentation pertaining to a specified spine. The word \"instrument\"
is used in a broad sense and embraces vocal qualities and vocal types as
well as mechanical sound makers.

Three distinctions are currently made in Humdrum: *instrument name,*
*instrument class* and *instrument group.* The following table
identifies six pre-defined instrument classes:

The following table identifies five pre-defined instrument groups:

The following set of tables list currently defined instrument names.
When the name is used to form an instrument tandem interpretation the
instrument keyword is preceded by an asterisk, `*`, and the upper-case letter
`I`. For example, the instrument tandem interpretation for the
guitar is `*Iguitr`. If the guitar appears as an instrument in a `AIN`
Reference Record only the designation `guitr` is used.
