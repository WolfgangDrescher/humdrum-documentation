<h1> Harmonic Intervals </h1>
</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------


In [Chapter&nbsp;11](/guide/ch11) we examined Humdrum tools related to
melodic pitch intervals. This chapter returns to the discussion of
intervals by focussing on two tools pertaining to characterizing
harmonic intervals: the <span class="tool">hint</span> and <span
class="tool">ydelta</span> commands.



## Types of Harmonic Intervals ##



Harmonic intervals identify pitch distances between nominally
concurrently-sounding notes. Example&nbsp;15.1 illustrates five types
of harmonic intervals. The most obvious harmonic intervals are those
that occur between pitches that have concurrent onsets. We might
call these *explicit harmonic intervals.* An example of an explicit
harmonic interval is the perfect octave in the first sonority of
Example&nbsp;15.1

```

Less obvious harmonic intervals arise when tone onsets are not
synchronous &mdash; yet both pitches are sustained simultaneously
for a period of time. We might call these *passing harmonic intervals.*
Two examples are evident in Example&nbsp;15.1: the minor seventh between
the D and the sustained C, and the minor sixth between E and C.
Most music theorists would argue that the minor sixth interval is
more important than the minor seventh. Compared with the D, the
following E has a longer duration and coincides with a stronger
metrical position. Hence the interval of the minor sixth is likely
to be more perceptually salient than the minor seventh interval.
We might call these intervals *strong passing intervals* and *weak
passing intervals* respectively.

Another type of harmonic interval may be deemed to occur even when
there are no concurrently sounding pitches. In Example&nbsp;15.1, the
alternating F&rarr;A and D&rarr;B imply subdominant and dominant
harmonic functions and so suggest the intervals of a major third
followed by a major sixth. We might call these intervals *implicit
harmonic intervals.* The harmonic status of the pitch sequence
A&rarr;D is more contentious; many theorists would argue that no
harmonic interval is implied either because of the weak&rarr;strong
metric relationship or because the harmonic interval is less
stereotypic of the given the cadential clich√©. Once again, implicit
harmonic intervals might be distinguished as weak or strong.

A further complication in identifying harmonic intervals arises
when there are more than two pitches involved. In the final four-note
chord of Example&nbsp;15.1, what harmonic intervals are implied?
Example&nbsp;15.2 shows three possible break-downs of the harmonic
relationships.  *Stacked harmonic intervals* include only the
intervals between successive pitches ordered from low to high. Four
pitches thus generate three intervals. *Bass-related harmonic
intervals* include all intervals calculated with respect to the
lowest pitch. Four pitches again leads to three (different) intervals.
This latter way of characterizing intervals is the most similar to
figured bass notation. *Permuted harmonic intervals* include all
intervals that can be calculated between all notes of a sonority.
Four pitches leads to six intervals.

A final issue in characterizing harmonic intervals is whether or
not the presence of unisons is important. In most applications (such
as figured bass) the presence of unisons is unimportant. In other
applications (such as tabulating instrument doubling in orchestration)
the occurrence of unisons is noteworthy.

By way of summary, we have distinguished five types of harmonic
intervals, and three measurement methods: explicit harmonic intervals,
implicit harmonic intervals (both strong and weak), plus passing
harmonic intervals (again both strong and weak varieties). Measurement
methods include (1) stacked harmonic intervals, (2) bass-related
harmonic intervals, and (3) permuted harmonic intervals.

As in the case of melodic intervals, harmonic intervals can be
calculated according to a variety of units &mdash; including diatonic
intervals, semitones, cents, frequency, and even cochlear coordinates.
We will consider just two tools for calculating harmonic intervals:
<span class="tool">hint</span> and <span class="tool">ydelta</span>.



## Harmonic Intervals Using the *hint* Command ##



The Humdrum <span class="tool">hint</span> command calculates
harmonic intervals for pitch-related representations such as <span
class="rep">kern</span>, <span class="rep">pitch</span>, <span
class="rep">solfg</span>, and <span class="rep">Tonh</span>. As in
the case of the <span class="tool">mint</span> command, output
intervals are expressed as a combination of diatonic interval size
plus interval quality (such as 'perfect fourth' and 'minor ninth').

In the default operation, <span class="tool">hint</span> calculates
only explicit harmonic intervals; for sonorities containing more
than two pitches, only stacked harmonic intervals are calculated.
The output from the <span class="tool">hint</span> command always
consists of a single <span class="rep">hint</span> spine. Any number
of spines may be present in the input, but only pitch-related spines
are processed. Given the default invocation, the output corresponding
to Example&nbsp;15.1 is as follows:

```humdrum
**hint
*M4/4
=1-
P8
-
-
-
-
-
-
=2
M3	m3	P4
*-
```

Notice that sonorities that contain only a single pitch result in
the outputting of a hyphen `-`. The hyphen indicates that pitched
material is present, but there are no explicit harmonic intervals.
Input records that contain no pitch tokens result in the outputting
of a null token (.). If a single duplicated pitch is present, then
the output will indicate a perfect unison (P1). Unisons can be
suppressed from the output via the <span class="option">u</span>
option for <span class="tool">hint</span>.

When more than two pitches are present in a sonority, *permuted
harmonic intervals* can be calculated by invoking the <span
class="option">a</span> option (i.e. *all* intervals). For example,
with the <span class="option">a</span> option, the final chord in
Example&nbsp;15.1 would produce the following output:

```humdrum
**hint
*all
M3 P5 P8 m3 m6 P4
*-
```

Notice the presence of the `*all` tandem interpretation in the above
output. This interpretation is added to the output in order to warn
users that the representation should not be interpreted as stacked
intervals.

*Bass-related harmonic intervals* can be calculated with the <span
class="option">l</span> option. In this case, harmonic intervals
are calculated with respect to the lowest pitch in the sonority.
This option is helpful in determining figured bass. For the final
chord in Example&nbsp;12.1 the corresponding output would be

```bash
**hint  M3 P5 P8  *-
```

Two further options for <span class="tool">hint</span> allow the
user to tailor how the intervals are represented. The <span
class="option">c</span> option causes compound intervals such as a
minor tenth (m10) to be output as non-compound equivalents (m3).
This means that the interval of an octave (P8) will be rendered as
a unison (P1). The <span class="option">d</span> option suppresses
the outputting of interval qualities and results in only diatonic
interval sizes being output.  Again, this option is helpful in
determining figured bass. The command:

```bash
hint -clud
```

will produce the following output for the final major chord in
Example&nbsp;12.1:

```bash
**hint  3 5  *-
```



## Propagating Data Using the *ditto* Command ##



In the default operation, <span class="tool">hint</span> calculates
intervals only between pitches that are explicitly present in an
input data record. This means that passing intervals are not
calculated.

In order to generate passing intervals, we will make use of the
Humdrum <span class="tool">ditto</span> command. The <span
class="tool">ditto</span> command replaces null tokens with the
previous non-null data token in the same spine.  Suppose we had an
arbitrary input such as the following:

```humdrum
**flip	**flop
A	xyz
.	jkl
.	.
B	abc
.	.
C	.
.	.
*-	*-
```

The effect of <span class="tool">ditto</span> would be the following:

```humdrum
**flip	**flop
A	xyz
A	jkl
A	jkl
B	abc
B	abc
C	abc
C	abc
*-	*-
```

Each null token has been replaced by the preceding data token within
the spine.

Consider the effect of <span class="tool">ditto</span> on the <span
class="rep">kern</span> data in Example&nbsp;15.1:

```bash
ditto -p example15.1
```

The following output results:

```humdrum
**kern	**kern
*M4/4	*M4/4
=1-	=1-
8c	2cc
8d	(2cc)
4e	(2cc)
8f	8r
8r	8a
8d	8r
8r	8b
=2	=2
2.c 2.e	2.g 2.cc
*-	*-
```

Notice that the half-note C5 has been repeated. The <span
class="option">p</span> option has caused each repetition of the
data token to be placed in parentheses so they can be easily
recognized. By using <span class="tool">ditto</span>, we have
transformed previously passing intervals into explicit sonorities
whose intervals can now be identified by <span class="tool">hint</span>.
We can combine the two commands in a single pipeline:

```bash
ditto example15.1 | hint
```

The resulting output for Example&nbsp;15.1 includes the two passing
intervals (m7 and m6) in the first measure:

```humdrum
**hint
*M4/4
=1-
P8
m7
m6
-
-
-
-
=2
M3 m3 P4
*-
```

The <span class="tool">ditto</span>, command provides two additional
options that are worthy of note: the <span class="option">s</span>
and <span class="option">c</span> options. The <span
class="option">s</span> option allows <span class="tool">ditto</span>
to skip or ignore the presence of certain data records. Suppose,
for example, that we had a barline in the midst of some null tokens:

```humdrum
A
.
=
.
```

Often, we would like to propagate certain data tokens *around* some
other types of data tokens, so the result might be:

```humdrum
A
A
=
A
```

By providing <span class="tool">ditto</span> with a suitable regular
expression, we can have the data token `A` skip over the barline:

```bash
ditto -s ^=
```

Without this option, the final data token in the above example would
be an equals-sign rather than the token `A`.

The <span class="option">c</span> option for <span
class="tool">ditto</span> allows the user to selectively identify
which characters are propagated. For example, the following command
will cause only the lower-case letters `a` and `b` to be propagated:

```bash
ditto -c ab
```

This feature allows users to replicate only certain kinds of data
&mdash; such as pitches, durations, dynamic marks, etc.

As we will see in future chapters, the <span class="tool">ditto</span>
command proves useful in a wide variety of situations apart from
calculating intervals.



## Using the *ditto* and *hint* Commands ##



Let's pause and consider some of the ways we might use the <span
class="tool">ditto</span> and <span class="tool">hint</span> commands.
First, let's determine if some input contains a particular interval.
Are there any augmented sixth intervals in Bach's two-part inventions?
The following commands look for explicit and passing sixths
respectively. Notice the use of the <span class="option">c</span>
option so octave equivalents will also be identified:

```bash
hint -c inventio* | grep A6
ditto -s ^= inventio* | hint -c | grep A6
```

Are there any diminished octave intervals between any two concurrent
notes in any of Beethoven's piano sonatas?

```bash
ditto -s ^= sonatas* | hint -a | grep d8
```

In orchestral works, some pairs of instruments are more likely than
others to double each other at the unison or octave. What proportion
of the intervals formed by the oboe and flute notes are doubled?
Since we are looking for a proportion, we need to make two counts:
the total number of (explicit) intervals formed by the oboe and
flute, and the number of those intervals that are octave equivalents.
(We will assume that there is only one oboe and one flute part in
the file `Rimsky-K`:)

```bash
extract -i '*Ioboe,*Iflts' Rimsky-K | hint -c | rid -GLId \
     | grep -c P1
extract -i '*Ioboe,*Iflts' Rimsky-K | hint -c | rid -GLId \
     | grep -c [MmPAd]
```

The second <span class="unix">grep</span> counts the total number
of intervals by looking for all of the interval qualities (major,
minor, perfect, etc.)

Suppose we have extracted two horn parts from an orchestral score.
Are octave intervals between the horns more likely to occur on the
dominant pitch or the tonic pitch?

```bash
solfa horns > temp1
hint horns > temp2
assemble temp1 temp2 | grep -c ^do.*P8
assemble temp1 temp2 | grep -c ^so.*P8
```



## Determining Implicit Harmonic Intervals ##



Recall that *implicit harmonic intervals* may be deemed to occur
between tones that don't actually sound at the same time. This
arises when one part has a rest while the other part is sounding.
Note that if we could eliminate rest tokens, then we could use <span
class="tool">ditto</span> to repeat previous pitch tokens in place
of the rests and so generate implicit harmonic intervals.

The <span class="tool">humsed</span> command (described in
[Chapter&nbsp;14](/guide/ch14)) is well suited to this task. We
want to transform any data token containing the letter \`r\' to a
null token. Consider the following substitution:

```bash
humsed 's/.*r.*/.    ./' example15.1
```

Unfortunately, this isn't quite right. The above substitution will
find any data record containing the letter `r` and transform the
entire record to a single null data record. We need to address
individual data tokens. In this example, rest tokens may be in two
possible positions: the first token in the record or the last token
in the record. We need two different regular expressions to address
each of these conditions.  First, a regular expression to identify
rests in the first token:

```bash
/^[^   ]*r[^   ]*   /
```

(That is, the beginning of the record `^`, followed by zero or
more instances of any character other than a tab `([^ ]*)`,
followed by the letter `r`, followed by zero or more instances
of any character other than a tab `([^ ]*)`, followed by a tab.)

Similarly, our second regular expression identifies rests in the last
token:

```text
/   [^   ]*r[^   ]*$/
```

Now we can eliminate rest tokens using the following two substitution
commands within a single invocation of <span class="tool">humsed</span>:

```bash
humsed 's/^[^  ]*r[^  ]*  /.  /; s/  [^  ]*r[^  ]*$/  ./' example15.1
```

The following output results:

```humdrum
**kern	**kern
*M4/4	*M4/4
=1-	=1-
8c	2cc
8d	.
4e	.
8f	.
.	8a
8d	.
.	8b
=2	=2
2.c 2.e	2.g 2.cc
*-	*-
```

If we now apply <span class="tool">ditto</span> and recalculate the
intervals, the resulting output will identify some implicit intervals
as well:

```bash
humsed 's/^[^  ]*r[^  ]*  /.  /; s/  [^  ]*r[^  ]*$/  ./' example15.1 \
     | ditto -p
```

Below we see the output assembled with the output from the corresponding
<span class="tool">hint</span> command:

```humdrum
**kern	**kern	**hint
*M4/4	*M4/4	*M4/4
=1-	=1-	=1-
8c	2cc	P8
8d	(2cc)	m7
4e	(2cc)	m6
8f	(2cc)	P5
(8f)	8a	M3
8d	(8a)	P5
(8d)	8b	M6
=2	=2	=2
2.c 2.e	2.g 2.cc	M3 m3 P4
*-	*-	*-
```



## The *ydelta* Command ##



Often it is useful to represent intervals by the number of semitones
(or some other numerical value). We might begin by using the <span
class="tool">semits</span> command to translate Example&nbsp;15.1 to a
<span class="rep">semits</span> representation.

```bash
semits example15.1
```

The resulting output would be as follows:


```humdrum
**semits	**semits
*M4/4	*M4/4
=1-	=1-
0	12
2	.
4	.
5	r
r	9
2	r
r	11
=2	=2
0 4	7 12
*-	*-
```

Numerical differences for values on a single data record can be
computed using the <span class="tool">ydelta</span> command. The
<span class="tool">ydelta</span> command is comparable to <span
class="tool">xdelta</span>, however, numerical differences are
calculated between simultaneous numerical values (delta-*y*) rather
than between successive numerical values (delta-*x*).

Like the <span class="tool">hint</span> command, <span
class="tool">ydelta</span> always outputs a single spine. The user
must specify which input spines are to be processed using the <span
class="option">i</span> option. In the following command, only
<span class="rep">semits</span> input is to be processed:

```bash
semits example15.1 | ydelta -s = -i '**semits'
```

The <span class="option">s</span> option allows the user to identify
data records to be *skipped* while processing. In this case, the
regular expression `=` is used to identify barlines, so measure
numbers will be excluded when processing the numerical data.

The above command yields the following output:

```humdrum
**Ysemits
*
=1-
12
.
.
.
.
.
.
=2
4 7 12
*-
```

Notice that <span class="tool">ydelta</span> prepends the upper-case
letter `Y` to the given input interpretation. All output values
are calculated with respect to the lowest value in the current data
record. Hence, the `4 7 12` in the last data record means that
there are pitches 4 semitones above the lowest note, 7 semitones
above the lowest note, and 12 semitones above the lowest note. (If
necessary, the lowest or offset value for each record can be output
in square brackets using the <span class="option">o</span> option.)

Like the <span class="tool">hint</span> command, <span
class="tool">ydelta</span> calculates numerical intervals only when
more than one value is present on a given input data record.  As
in the case of <span class="tool">hint</span>, we might use the
<span class="tool">ditto</span> command to propagate pitch values
&mdash; replacing all the null data tokens. A suitable command would
be:

```bash
semits example15.1 | ditto -s = | ydelta -s = -i '**semits'
```

The resulting output would be:

```humdrum
**Ysemits
*
=1-
12
10
8
.
.
.
.
=2
4 7 12
*-
```



## More Examples Using the *ydelta* Command ##



What is the average semitone distance between the cantus and altus
voices in Lassus motets? We can answer this question by first
extracting the appropriate voices and translating to a semitone
representation.

```bash
extract -f 1,2 motet* | semits > temp1
```

Using <span class="tool">ditto</span> we can expand the pitched
material so that concurrently-sounding tones will generate explicit
intervals. We then use <span class="tool">ydelta</span> to calculate
the actual semitone interval distances. The <span class="tool">rid</span>
command can be used to eliminate non-data records, and the <span
class="unix">grep -v</span> command can be used to further eliminate
barlines. Finally, we can calculate the mean interval distance using
the <span class="tool">stats</span> command:

```bash
ditto -s = temp1 | ydelta -s = -i '**semits' | rid -GLId \
     | grep -v = | stats
```

Suppose we have a two-part input. Are there tritone intervals
(explicit and passing) that are not spelled as either an augmented
fourth or diminished fifth? We can answer this question by using
both <span class="tool">hint</span> and <span class="tool">ydelta</span>
and a suitable sequence of <span class="unix">grep</span> commands.
The <span class="tool">ditto</span> command is used to ensure that
both explicit and passing intervals are generated.

```bash
ditto -s = 2part | semits | ydelta -s = -i '**semits' > temp1
ditto -s = 2part | hint > temp2
assemble temp1 temp2 | rid -GLId | grep ^6 | grep -v A4 \
     | grep -v d5
```

Notice the use of <span class="unix">grep -v</span> to first exclude
any records that match an augmented fourth, and then to exclude any
remaining records that match a diminished fifth.



## Reprise ##



Harmonic intervals can be measured in a variety of ways. They can
be characterized as diatonic qualities such as minor sevenths or
augmented sixths. They can be measured in terms of semitone distance
&mdash; or even in cents or hertz (frequency difference). Only the
diatonic size may be of interest (e.g., "a fifth"), and compound
intervals (e.g., major tenth) can be expressed by their non-compound
equivalents (major third).

At least five types of harmonic intervals can be distinguished
including *explicit harmonic intervals*, *strong passing intervals*,
*weak passing intervals*, *strong implicit harmonic intervals* and
*weak implicit harmonic intervals*. In addition, we distinguished
three different ways of characterizing harmonic intervals: *stacked
harmonic intervals*, *bass-related harmonic intervals* and *permuted
harmonic intervals*.

In this chapter we have seen how to use the <span class="tool">hint</span>
command to calculate these various kinds of intervals. We have also
seen how <span class="tool">ydelta</span> can be used to measure
purely numerical distances between concurrent values.
