<h1> Chapter 6 </h1>
<h1> Representing Music Using **kern (II) </h1>
</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------


In this chapter we return to consider several more advanced topics
related to the <span class="rep">kern</span> representation.

Tuplets
-------

As we saw in [Chapter 2](/guide/ch02), <span class="rep">kern</span> durations are
represented using a reciprocal number notation. With the exception of
the value zero, durations are represented by reciprocal numerical values
corresponding to the American duration names: "1" for whole note,
"8" for eighth, "32" for thirty-second, etc. The number zero (0) is
reserved for the breve duration (a duration of twice the length of a
whole note).

Dotted durations are indicated by adding the period character (.)
immediately following the numerical value, hence "`8.`" signifies a
dotted eighth-note and "`2..`" signifies a doubly dotted half-note.
Any number of augmentation dots may follow the duration integer.

Triplet and other irregular durations are represented using the same
reciprocal logic. Consider, for example, the quarter-note triplet
duration. Three quarter triplets occur in the time of four quarters or
one whole duration. If we divide a whole duration ("`1`") into three
equal parts, each part has a duration of one-third. The corresponding
reciprocal integer for 1/3 is 3, hence <span class="rep">kern</span> represents a
quarter-note triplet as a "third-note", `3`. Similarly, eighth-note
triplets are represented by the integer 6 and sixteenth-note triplets
are represented by the integer 12. Eighth-note quintuplets (5 in the
time of 4) will be represented by the value 10 (a half duration divided
by 5).

In general, the way to determine the <span class="rep">kern</span> equivalent of an arbitrary
"tuplet" duration is to multiply the number of tuplets by the total
duration which they occupy. If 7 notes of equal duration occupy the
duration of a whole-note ("`1`"), then each septuplet is represented
by the value 7 (i.e. 1 x 7). A more extreme example is 23 notes in the
time of a doubly dotted quarter. The appropriate <span class="rep">kern</span> duration can
be found by multiplying 4 by 23 (equals 92) and adding the appropriate
augmentation dots. Thus "92.." is the correct <span class="rep">kern</span> encoding for a
note whose duration is 23 notes in the time of a doubly-dotted quarter.

By way of illustration, example 6.1 shows an excerpt from Sigfrid
Karg-Elert's *Caprices* Op. 107, No. 23 for solo flute. The work is in
3/4 meter. The last beat of the first measure has 9 notes in the time of
a quarter duration. The reciprocal encoding is 9 x 4 or 36th notes.

**Example 6.1.** Karg-Elert, *Caprices* Op. 107, No. 23.

Another set of tuplets appears in the last beat of the second measure.
In this case, five notes are played in the time of a quarter, hence the
reciprocal durations are 5 x 4 or 20th notes.

In the last measure of the example, five notes are played in the time of
an eighth-note: 5 x 8 or 40th notes. Note that the 40th notes are half
the duration of the 20th notes in the previous measure.

Other noteworthy observations regarding example 6.1: notice the tenuto
markings (`~`) on the first two notes of the second measure. Also notice
that the duration of the last note in the example is indeterminate. It
could be a sixteenth note, a quintuplet sixteenth, or some other
duration.


Grace Notes, Gruppettos and Appoggiaturas
-----------------------------------------

The <span class="rep">kern</span> representation also allows for the encoding of grace notes
(acciaccaturas, non-canonical gruppettos, and appoggiaturas.

Depending on the expected analytic application, one way to handle these
notational devices is to encode the notes according to the manner in
which they are typically performed. Alternatively, since the component
notes of an expanded ornament are viewed as embellishments that hold
potentially less analytic status, a special designation for these notes
can be useful for certain types of studies.

*Grace notes* (acciaccaturas) are visually rendered as miniature notes
with a slash drawn through the stem. In the <span class="rep">kern</span> representation
these notes are treated as "durationless" notes and are designated by
the lower-case letter "`q`". Hence, the token "`G#q`" denotes a G#3
grace note with an indeterminate duration.

Non-canonical *gruppettos* are miniature (non-cue) notes (typically
appearing in groups) whose stems do not contain a slash, and whose
notated durations cause the total notated duration for the measure to
exceed the prevailing meter. These gruppetto notes are encoded as notes
retaining their notated durations, but all such notes are also
designated by the upper-case letter "`Q`". Hence, a miniature
sixteenth-note middle C would be encoded as "`16cQ`".

When processed by various tools in the Humdrum Toolkit, these notes may
be treated as equivalent to their notated durations. Alternatively, in
some types of processing these notes may be discarded. For example, the
Humdrum [<span class="tool">timebase</span>](/command/timebase) command (described in
[Chapter 13)](/guide/ch13) eliminates acciaccaturas and gruppetto
notes. Note that data records containing acciaccaturas or gruppetto
notes must *not* also include normal notes.

In the case of *appoggiaturas,* <span class="rep">kern</span> requires that they be encoded
as performed. An appropriate duration is assigned to the appoggiatura
according to common performance practice. The duration of the subsequent
note is reduced by a corresponding amount. The status of the two notes
forming the appoggiatura is nevertheless marked. The appoggiatura note
itself is designated by the upper-case letter "`P`", whereas the
subsequent note (whose notated duration has been shortened) is
designated by the lower-case letter "`p`".


Multiple Stops
--------------

In the <span class="rep">kern</span> representation, spines typically represent individual
musical parts or voices. Occasionally, a nominally single "part"
contains more than one concurrent note. A good example of such a
situation occurs when a violin plays a double stop.

The <span class="rep">kern</span> representation provides three different ways of
representing such situations: (1) multiple stops, (2) spine splitting
and rejoining, and (3) introduction and retiring of a momentary
"part". Each of these representation methods captures a different way
of interpreting the music. The best representation will depend on the
editorial or processing goal.

First we will consider the generic Humdrum *subtoken.* A data token
becomes a multiple stop when two or more subtokens are present,
separated by single spaces. By way of illustration, the following
<span class="rep">kern</span> data represents a scale played in ascending thirds:

{% include verovio.html
	source="guide-06-1c"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="800"
	humdrum-min-height="200px"
%}

<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="guide-06-1c">
**kern
4c 4e
8d 8f
8e 8g
8f 8a
8g 8b
8a 8cc
8b 8dd
4cc 4ee
*-
</script>

An important restriction for multiple stops in the <span class="rep">kern</span>
representation is that they must encode notes of the same duration. In
the above example, the left and right components of the multiple stop
always share the same duration. (Note that this is a restriction of
multiple stops in the <span class="rep">kern</span> representation only, and does not
necessarily apply to other Humdrum representations.)

Notice that multiple stops are represented with a single spine (that is,
there are no tabs present).

Multiple stops may occur at any point in a <span class="rep">kern</span> spine. For example,
the following <span class="rep">kern</span> data represents a scale that begins and ends with
chords:

{% include verovio.html
	source="guide-06-1d"
	scale="55"
	pageWidth="800"
	humdrum-min-height="200px"
%}

<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="guide-06-1d">
**kern
4c 4e 4g
8d
8e
8f
8g
8a
8b
4cc 4ee 4gg 4ccc
*-
</script>

The first chord has been encoded as a triple stop, whereas the last
chord has been encoded as a quadruple stop. Notice once again that all
of the notes within a multiple stop must have the same duration. If the
durations of the concurrent notes differ, then one must use Humdrum
spine path indicators (see below).

Example 6.2 illustrates a musical context where multiple stops may be
appropriate. The sample passage is from a keyboard work by Telemann. The
work is almost entirely in two parts with only occasional chords. Since
the chords always contain notes of equal duration, they can be encoded
as double stops within a single part.

**Example 6.2.** Telemann, *Kleine Fantasien f√ºr Klavier* No. 7.

When encoding multiple stops in the <span class="rep">kern</span> representation, some note
attributes should be encoded for each note in the multiple stop, whereas
other markings should be encoded only once for the entire multiple stop.
Note-related attributes such as articulation marks, stem directions, and
ties should be encoded for each note in the multiple stop. By contrast,
phrase marks, slurs, and beamings should be encoded once for the entire
multiple stop. Example 6.3 provides a contrived example that illustrates
these conventions. Notice that the first double stop encodes a single
open phrase (i.e. \``{`\') and the last double stop encodes a single
close phrase (\``}`\'). Similarly, the slur in the middle of the phrase
has been encoded once. However, the staccato markings have been encoded
for both notes in each of the double stops. Similarly, separate ties
have been encoded for both notes in the double stop.

**Example 6.3.** Attribute encoding for <span class="rep">kern</span> multiple stops.

Further Examples
----------------

Example 6.4 shows an excerpt from a Chopin *Etude* that illustrates a
number of subtle features in the <span class="rep">kern</span> representation.

The opening measure consists solely of gruppetto notes; each has been
designated by the upper-case letter \`Q\'. The double-barline has been
indicated with two thin lines. Two tandem interpretations encode the
meter signature (`*M3/4`) and the tempo (`*MM66`). Note that metronome
markings using the `*MM` interpretation are always given in
quarter-durations per minute. If the metronome marking had been given as
half-note equals 48, then the tempo interpretation would be given as
`*MM96` &mdash; i.e. quarter-note equals 96 beats per minute.

Two grace-notes are evident in the passage. The first occurs just after
the double-bar, and the second occurs three measures later. These notes
have been encoded with duration values, but are designated by the
lower-case letter \``q`\'. Notice that grace-notes are always treated as
"durationless" notes. Grace notes must always be encoded on a separate
data record. Concurrent grace notes can be encoded on the same data
record, but grace notes must never share the same data record with a
regular note. Another peculiarity of grace notes is that they are always
assumed to be slurred to the ensuing note (if there is a subsequent
note). Thus slurs should not be encoded as part of the grace note.

The grace-note E-natural coincides with the end of the first phrase and
the beginning of the second phrase. The phrases are said to be
"elided" (overlapping). Since <span class="rep">kern</span> phrases are represented by open
and close braces, the ampersand character is used to indicate elisions.

Notice that the \`inner\' accompaniment chords have been encoded as
double stops. This is possible because the notes in these double stops
are all the same duration.

Finally, notice how the triplet eighth-notes (encoded as duration
`12`) have been interleaved with the concurrent eighth-note figures so
that the onsets are ordered in the correct temporal sequence.
