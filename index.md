# Welcome

Welcome to the homepage for the Humdrum Toolkit, a set of resources for computational
music analysis.  Here you will find instructions on downloading,
installing, and using the Humdrum Toolkit as well as other resoures.

Humdrum was originally created by David Huron in the 1980s, and it has been used
steadily for decades. The Humdrum "universe" might be thought of as consisting of
two main segments: the notational style (\*\*kern notation) and the software for 
analyzing the notated material. This software exists in the original format (the Humdrum 
Toolkit), as well as the updated and extended version (Craig Sapp's Humdrum Extras)

Because the Humdrum software consists of a set of command-line tools, it is  
program-language agnostic, meaning the tools can be incorporated however you choose. 
Many have employed Humdrum tools in larger scripts that use PERL, R, Ruby, Python,
Bash, LISP, and C++, to name but a few.
