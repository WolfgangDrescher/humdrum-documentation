# Welcome #

Welcome to the homepage for the Humdrum Toolkit, a set of resources
for computational music analysis.  Here you will find instructions
on downloading, installing, and using the Humdrum Toolkit as well
as other resources.

Humdrum was originally created by David Huron in the 1980s, and it
has been used steadily for decades. The Humdrum "universe" might
be thought of as consisting of two main segments: the notational
style (particularly the \*\*kern representation) and the software
for analyzing the notated material. This software exists in the
original format (the Humdrum Toolkit), as well as the updated and
extended versions (such as Craig Sapp's Humdrum Extras, and VHV/humlib).

Because the Humdrum software consists of a set of command-line
tools, it is program-language agnostic, meaning the tools can be
incorporated however you choose.  Many have employed Humdrum tools
in larger scripts that use
