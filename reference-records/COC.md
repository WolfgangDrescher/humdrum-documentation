	Composer's corporate name.
</span>

Corporate names may include the names of popular groups (especially
when the actual composer is not known). Corporate names may also
include business names, such as *Muzak*.  If the corporate name is
in reference to one of multiple composers in <a class="reflink">COM</a>
entry, then any enumeration number attached to the COM record should
match that of the COC record.
