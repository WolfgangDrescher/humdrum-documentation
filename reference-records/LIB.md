	Librettist.
</span>

The name of the librettist. If more than one librettist was involved
in the work, then each librettist's name should appear on a separate
<span class="refname">LIB</span> record with an enumeration number
prior to the colon. If the composer was also the librettist, this
should be explicitly encoding using an independent <span
class="refname">LIB</span> record rather than implicitly assumed.
