<span class="reference-summary">
	Librettist's name.
</span>

The name of the librettist. If more than one librettist was involved
in the work, then each librettist's name should appear on a separate
<span class="refname">LIB</span> record with an enumeration number
prior to the colon. If the composer was also the librettist, this
should be explicitly encoding using an independent <span
class="refname">LIB</span> record rather than implicitly assumed.

### Sub-categorizations ###

Librettists and other roles other than the composer do not have a
specific reference record for birth and death dates.  Such
information can be added as a sub-categorization of the person's
reference record.  Here is an example of adding dates for the 
librettist:

```
!!!LIB: Da Ponte, Lorenzo
!!!LIB-CDT: 1749/03/10-1838/08/17
```
