	Lyricist's name.
</span>

If more than one lyricist was involved in the work, then each
lyricist's name should appear in a separate <span
class="refname">LYR</span> record with an enumeration number prior
to the colon. If the composer was also the lyricist,  this should
be explicitly encoding using the independent <span class="refname">LYR</span>
record rather than implicitly assumed.
