<td>
<a name="COA"></a>
</td>
<td markdown="1">
<span class="reference-summary">
	Attributed composer.
</span>

This may include attributions known to be false. Multiple attributions
to different composers should be placed into separate <span class="refname">COA</span>
entries with an added number

```
!!!COA1: Composer 1
!!!COA2: Composer 2
```

Alternate names for the attributed composer can be added to a line, separating the
alternate names by a semicolon (`;`).

Note that if a document contains both <span class="refname">COA</span>
and <a class="reflink">COM</a> records, then the attributed composer
is implicitly assumed to be false.
